# Version Bump Instruction
Before the diff context, assess whether this PR requires a Semantic Versioning bump (patch, minor, or major).
Check the current \`version\` in \`pyproject.toml\` on the feature branch (\`${safeHeadRef}\`) against \`pyproject.toml\` on \`${baseBranch}\`. If it is already bumped, do not perform any file modifications.
If a bump is required and not already done:
1. Canonicalise the version from \`pyproject.toml\`.
2. Update \`version\` in \`pyproject.toml\` to the new SemVer version.
3. Update \`__version__\` in \`pyquantflow/__init__.py\` to match.
4. Run \`uv lock\` to update the lockfile.
5. Create a pull request targeting the \`${safeHeadRef}\` branch with title \`chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z\`.

# What to review
Focus ONLY on lines changed in this diff. Evaluate for:
- Correctness: logic errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, edge cases.
- Security: injection risks, hardcoded secrets, auth flaws, sensitive data in logs.
- Reliability: missing error handling, unhandled promise rejections.
- Dependency Version Verification: when evaluating dependency versions, if you do not recognise high version numbers, flag them as a [WARN] stating your cut-off limitation, do not block them as hallucinations.

# Severity tags
Tag each finding EXACTLY one of:
- [BLOCKING] — high-confidence correctness/security flaws (>80% confidence).
- [WARN] — meaningful concerns worth addressing but not blocking.
- [NIT] — small readability or consistency notes (max 3).

# Output format (STRICT)
Respond in Markdown using sections: ## Summary, ## Strengths, ## Findings (grouped by severity heading), and ## SemVer Assessment. End with EXACTLY one line:
\`VERDICT: approve\` — no blocking issues.
\`VERDICT: comment\` — has warnings/nits but nothing blocking.
\`VERDICT: block\` — one or more BLOCKING issues.`;
